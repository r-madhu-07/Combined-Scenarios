# NAME: MADHUMITHA R
# REG NO: 212224240082
# AIM:
To ideate solutions for a UX problem, create user stories and scenarios, design task flow diagrams, and
develop information architecture through card sorting and site mapping.

# PROCEDURE:
1.Select a known UX problem (e.g., booking an appointment in a hospital app) and perform a crazy 8s or
brainwriting exercise to generate multiple low-fidelity solution ideas.

2.Using personas and their goals, write at least five user stories in the format: As a [user], I want to [goal], so
that [benefit].

3.Choose one user story and create a detailed narrative scenario describing the user’s context, including
emotional states, tasks, and environment.

4.Select a task (e.g., ordering food via an app) and draw a task flow or user flow diagram using standard
symbols like start, decision, and action.

5.Take an example website or app (e.g., university site or news portal) and perform a card sorting exercise
(open or closed).

6.Based on card sorting results, create a site map showing the categorized structure of the information
architecture.

 # 1. Solution Ideation – "Booking an Appointment in a Hospital App"
# Ideation Method: Crazy 8s (Condensed)
Each "crazy" idea focuses on a diƯerent way to improve appointment
booking in a hospital app.
 1. Voice-Based Booking:
Users can say “Book me an appointment with a dermatologist
next week” and get a confirmation.
 2. Calendar Sync Option:
Show doctor availability directly in the user’s calendar with dragand-drop appointment booking.
 3. Chatbot Interface:
A smart assistant walks users through booking in a
conversational way.
 4. One-Tap Rebook:
Button on the homepage to rebook the same doctor and time as
the last visit.
 5. Specialty Finder Wizard:
Interactive Q&A flow to help users pick the right department
based on symptoms.
 6. Smart Suggest:
Suggests ideal times based on user’s location, preferences, and
urgency.
 7. Family Profiles:
Switch between profiles to book for self, child, or elder without
re-entering info. 

# 2. Creating User Stories
Using personas from the earlier hospital app scenario (Sarah and
Mike):
1. As a busy professional (Sarah), I want to book a doctor in under 2
minutes, so that I don’t interrupt my workday.
2. As a health-conscious user (Mike), I want to see detailed doctor
ratings, so that I can choose based on other patients’
experiences.
3. As a diabetic patient (Sarah), I want to rebook regular checkups
easily, so that I can maintain my health routine without hassle.
4. As a caregiver, I want to book appointments for my family, so
that I can manage everyone’s health in one place.
5. As a tech-savvy user (Mike), I want to get appointment reminders
on my smartwatch, so that I never miss a consultation. 

# 3. Creating a Scenario
Selected User Story:
As a diabetic patient (Sarah), I want to rebook regular checkups easily,
so that I can maintain my health routine without hassle.
Scenario Narrative:
Sarah, a 34-year-old marketing executive, is on her way to work on a
Monday morning. She remembers she’s due for her quarterly diabetic
checkup. While riding the train, she opens the hospital app. She feels
slightly anxious—missing appointments in the past led to
complications. She hopes the app has improved since the last time.
In the app, she sees a “Rebook Dr. Ahmed” button on the homepage.
Relieved, she taps it. The app auto-fills her preferred day and time
based on her past visit. She confirms in two taps. A push notification
and calendar invite pop up. Sarah feels confident and empowered,
knowing she’s staying on top of her health without breaking her
routine.
